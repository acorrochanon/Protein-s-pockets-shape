# SCRIPT
# 1 - SPLITS RANDOMLY THE DATA BASED ON UNIPROTSID. ENTER THE TRAIN SPLIT SIZE PERCENTAGE AS A 0-1 SCALAR (e.g., 0.8 = 80%)
# 2 - EXECUTE THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION WITH THE SCALAR FEATURES GENERATED BY FPOCKET. 
# 3 - EXECUTE THE E3NN WITH THE SAME DATA (TRAIN SET WILL EVENTUALLY BE SPLIT INTO TRAIN AND VAL SETS) 

# NOTES:
# - split_data.py : EVERY TIME SPLIT_DATA IS CALLED, NEW SPLITS OF TRAIN AND TEST SETS ARE GENERATED (NO FIXED SEED)
# - learning_shapes: TRAIN AND VALIDATION SPLITS WILL BE THE SAME UNDER THE SAME TRAIN-TEST SETS GENERATED IN THE PREVIOUS STEP. (FIXED SEED)
# - MAKE SURE TO ENTER ABSOLUTE PATHS CORRECTLY.
